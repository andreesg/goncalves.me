	<li>I'm exploring responsive front-end with Foundation framework. Responsive for retina, xlarge, large, medium and small screens. </li>
	<li>I'll try AngularJS + Socket.io and NodeJS to make a cool "Live Chat" enabling customers to communicate with me live (I will also develop the mobile application to answer the messages, live, in Steroids.js for sure).</li>
